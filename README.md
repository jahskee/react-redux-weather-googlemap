# Technical assignment front-end engineer
Make an application that allows the user to view the observed (in the past 30 days) or forecasted (in the future) daily weather conditions for a given location using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs).

You are free to use the tools and frameworks you prefer unless stated otherwise.

**Requirements**

The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.
* Use ReactJS
* Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care
* Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using CSS or your favourite CSS preprocessor
* Communicate to the Dark Sky API through a PHP back-end

**Timing**

We don't specify a timeframe for the assignment. Just ping us when you are done, on this endpoint ([Slack incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)): `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`. Please mention your name and a link to what we need to review.
